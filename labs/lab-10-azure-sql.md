# Lab 10 — Create an Azure SQL Database

In this lab you deploy a fully managed Azure SQL Database preloaded with the AdventureWorksLT sample data and query it directly from the browser — no database server to install, patch, or back up. This maps to the AZ-900 skill area **Describe Azure architecture and services** — database services and the PaaS shared-responsibility model.

## Step 1 — Start the SQL Database wizard

1. Click **Create a resource** → search **SQL Database** → **Create** → **SQL Database**.
2. On the **Basics** tab set:
   - Subscription: your free subscription
   - Resource group: `rg-az900-labs` (create it if it doesn't exist)
   - Database name: `db-az900`

---

## Step 2 — Create a new logical server

1. Under **Server**, click **Create new** and enter:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Server name | `sql-az900-<yourinitials><random>` (e.g. `sql-az900-tan4821` — globally unique) |
   | Location | `Southeast Asia` |
   | Authentication method | `Use SQL authentication` |
   | Server admin login | `sqladmin` |
   | Password | a strong password — write it down, you need it in Step 6 |

2. Click **OK**.

The logical server is a management boundary (logins, firewall rules) — it is not a VM you can log into.

---

## Step 3 — Choose a cheap compute + storage tier

1. Back on **Basics**, set **Workload environment** = `Development` if offered.
2. Under **Compute + storage**, click **Configure database**.
3. Choose one of the two lab-friendly options:
   - **Service tier** = `Basic` (5 DTUs, 2 GB) — simplest and about USD 5/month, or
   - **Service tier** = `General Purpose (Serverless)` with **Auto-pause delay** = 1 hour and min/max vCores at the lowest values — bills per second of use and pauses when idle.
4. Click **Apply**. On **Basics**, set **Backup storage redundancy** = `Locally-redundant backup storage`.

Serverless with auto-pause is the cloud consumption model in miniature: pay only while the database is active.

---

## Step 4 — Configure networking

1. Click **Next: Networking** and set:
   - Connectivity method: `Public endpoint`
   - Allow Azure services and resources to access this server: `Yes`
   - Add current client IP address: `Yes`
2. Leave **Connection policy** at Default.

By default a SQL server's firewall blocks everything; these two rules admit Azure services (needed by Query editor) and your own machine.

---

## Step 5 — Load sample data and create

1. Click **Next: Security** — leave defaults (make sure **Microsoft Defender for SQL** = `Not now` to avoid charges).
2. Click **Next: Additional settings** and set:
   - Use existing data: `Sample` (this loads the **AdventureWorksLT** database; accept the collation prompt)
3. Click **Review + create** → **Create**. Deployment takes 2–5 minutes; then click **Go to resource**.

---

## Step 6 — Query the database from the browser

1. On the **db-az900** database blade, click **Query editor (preview)** in the left menu.
2. Sign in with **SQL server authentication**: login `sqladmin` and your password from Step 2.
3. In the query pane, run:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 Name, ListPrice FROM SalesLT.Product ORDER BY ListPrice DESC;
```

4. Click **Run** — the 10 most expensive AdventureWorks products appear in the Results grid.

You just queried a production-grade SQL database entirely from a browser. If you chose serverless and the DB auto-paused, the first query may take ~30 seconds to resume — that's the trade-off for paying nothing while paused.

---

## Step 7 — Observe what PaaS removed from your plate

1. On the database's **Overview** blade note: compute tier, storage used, and the server name `sql-az900-....database.windows.net`.
2. Look at the left menu: there is no "Restart VM", no OS, no patching schedule. Under **Data management → Backups** (on the server) note that automated backups with point-in-time restore are already running — you configured nothing.

With SQL on an Azure VM (IaaS) you would patch Windows and SQL Server yourself; with Azure SQL Database (PaaS), Microsoft handles the OS, engine patching, HA, and backups.

---

## Step 8 — Check the server firewall

1. From the database **Overview**, click the **Server name** link to open the logical server.
2. In the left menu click **Security → Networking**.
3. Under **Firewall rules**, see the rule with your client IP (added in Step 4) and the checkbox **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server**.
4. Note you could delete the client rule to instantly cut off your own access — the firewall is the outer gate before SQL authentication even happens.

Defense in depth: network firewall first, then authentication, then database permissions.

---

## Clean up

Delete the database and the logical server (keep resource group `rg-az900-labs` — it is reused until Lab 16). In Cloud Shell:

```bash
az sql db delete --resource-group rg-az900-labs --server sql-az900-<yourinitials><random> --name db-az900 --yes
az sql server delete --resource-group rg-az900-labs --name sql-az900-<yourinitials><random> --yes
```

Or in the portal: open `rg-az900-labs`, tick **db-az900** and the SQL server, click **Delete**. Basic tier bills daily, so don't leave it running.

## What you learned

- **Azure SQL Database** is a PaaS relational database: Microsoft manages the OS, patching, high availability, and automated backups.
- A **logical SQL server** is an administrative boundary for logins and firewall rules, not a machine.
- **DTU (Basic)** vs **vCore serverless with auto-pause** are two purchasing models — serverless embodies pay-per-use consumption pricing.
- The **server firewall** blocks all access by default; you explicitly allow client IPs and Azure services.
- **Query editor** in the portal lets you run T-SQL with zero client tooling — useful for quick verification and demos.
